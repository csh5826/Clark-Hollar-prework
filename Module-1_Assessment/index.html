          <p>I was born and raised in Durham, North Carolina. I attended the university of North Carolina Wilmington where I got my degree in Finance. While I attended school I had the opportunity to study abroad in England and spent a lot of my free time traveling around Europe and even got the chance to visit north Africa for a week. I love exploring new places and cultures and especially love trying the different cuisines in the places.</p>

        <p>After my 4 years of school I took a job in the software industry at a company in Raleigh, NC called SoftPro. SoftPro is the nations leader in real estate closing and title insurance. Here is where I found my passion for technology which has now pushed me into software development. I hope to grow my career in software as a software engineer and get into a UI position eventually.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of work I love to stay active. I enjoy hitting the gym regularly and also love going on runs outside. I have a passion for all board sports, especially snowboarding. I had the opporunity to learn how to surf during my four years at UNCW which is conventiely located just minutes from the beach.</p>
